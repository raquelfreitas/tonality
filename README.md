## Development Notes

### VS Code setup

To ensure intellisense plays nicely with the recommended extensions, be sure to disable *CSS validation* on your settings.
To do so, open your settings (shortcut **ctrl/cmd + ,**) and search for css validate. Disable _CSS: Validate_.

### VS Code extensions

These are highly recommended for proper development on this project:

* Vetur
* ESLint and stylelint
* Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
